# Haxe solutions

**List problems (1 - 28)** are solved without using any of Haxe's built-in Array methods. A lot of these problems would otherwise be solved in a handful of lines. The point of these exercises should be to implement your own solutions, after all.

_Note:_ I skipped over #13 because I don't fully understand what I'm supposed to do. I may have already solved it in #11. And #7 was glanced over by accident so I'll have it up soon.
